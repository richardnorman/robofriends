## Robofriends was made with React and Redux!
This react app was made with create-react-app, which produces a fully optimized react application. It includes state management with Redux, the use of props and some component lifecycle methods. An error boundary was also implemented to ensure graceful error handling if a component fails.

### How it works
Simply type in a robots name in the list and the CardList will automatically update. The list of robots was received via a fetch call from robohash.org
